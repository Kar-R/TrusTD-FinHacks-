TrusTD

TrusTD is a service that tracks and resolves IOU promises through block-chain technology to help eliminate micro transactions. It incorporates IoT to suggest the right time and place to pay for any unresolved promises. It uses communication through natural language processing to interact with a Cisco Spark bot that tracks IOUs.

How does it work?

To use, the Spark App has to be downloaded and the bot has to be added, the person then has to be tagged in a statement that includes an IOU transaction. The bot then verifies through a question and answer from the person tagged. Example "Hey TrusTD, Calen owes me 12 bucks for lunch", TrusTD will then send a message to Calen asking if this is true. Calen is the only one who can confirm. The accounts will then be tracked through TrusTD. When one wants to resolve the account or make a payout, they can ask "TrusTD how much do I owe?" and it will check of you owe anything to anyone.
